{- | On a Df input, packetize the data such that it can be fed into `etherboneC` without trouble.

The problem this function intends to solve is that for certain kinds of mediums, the complete
packet length isn't known ahead of time. Making the construction of the `PacketStream` difficult.

This function allows one to have a stream of bytes and it will attempt to format it into a
`PacketStream`, so it can be fed to `etherboneC`.

# Limitations

For now, this function __ONLY__ supports 32 bit etherbone packets. 64 bit etherbone packets will
get treated as 32 bit, which __WILL__ cause you problems if you try it. So don't :)

Another limitation is that due to the nature of etherbone, it is impossible for us to determine
how many EBRecords there are. This function assumes each etherbone packet only contains
__one__ EBRecord.
